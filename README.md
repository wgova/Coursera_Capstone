# Recommender-Central-Toronto
Recommender system for some friends who were planning a trip to Toronto on an academic exchange 

The project was aimed at recommending the best boroughs to get accomodation options for a group of friends who were planning to self-cater, possibly in an Airbnb or guest houses. Their concern was being far from amenities like shopping centres and places of interest, as well as lively atmosphere for fun. The project makes use of data from various sources to identify the best boroughs.
